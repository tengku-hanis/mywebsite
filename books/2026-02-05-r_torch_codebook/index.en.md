## **Abstract**

![](featured.png){width="40%"}

This book serves as a consolidated repository of R code for deep learning, providing a comprehensive collection of implementations using the torch ecosystem. Designed as a functional reference, it offers a streamlined approach to building models across various data modalities, ranging from tabular and imaging data to audio and video data. While the book is currently in the early stages of development, a preliminary draft of these code implementations is available for free via [the author's GitHub page](https://tengku-hanis.github.io/r_torch_codebook/).
