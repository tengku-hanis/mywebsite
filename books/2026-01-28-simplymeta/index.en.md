![](featured.png){width="40%"}

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the basics of meta-analysis, offering a step-by-step guide to conducting analyses using [SimplyMeta](https://019bfe8d-2c8a-9a12-45d3-bbcac429bb35.share.connect.posit.cloud/). Developed by the author, [SimplyMeta](https://019bfe8d-2c8a-9a12-45d3-bbcac429bb35.share.connect.posit.cloud/) is a web application designed to streamline and simplify the analytical process for all users. While both the book and the application are currently in the early stages of development, a preliminary draft is available for free via the [the author's GitHub page](https://tengku-hanis.github.io/simplymeta_book/). Future updates will introduce several other related functions to the web app, with corresponding detailed explanations will be added in the book.
