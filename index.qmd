## Background

I earned my PhD in Public Health Epidemiology from [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/), where I explored the potential applications of machine learning and deep learning in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer among Asian women.

My academic journey began with a degree in medicine. However, I realized that a clinical career was not the right fit for me. This led me to pursue a master's degree in [Medical Statistics](https://medic.usm.my/index.php/biostat), where I developed a deep interest in data analysis. Coming from a medical background gives me a unique perspective on data, allowing me to bridge the gap between healthcare and data science.

Currently, I am a Senior Lecturer at the [Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin](https://fp.unisza.edu.my/) in Terengganu, Malaysia. I welcome collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
