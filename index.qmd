## Background

I am a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Community Medicine, [Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin](https://fp.unisza.edu.my/) in Terengganu, Malaysia. I teach biostatistics and machine learning to both undergraduate and postgraduate students, and I’m always open to collaborations — feel free to get in touch!

I hold a PhD in Public Health Epidemiology from [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/), where my research focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer among Asian women.

My academic journey began with a degree in medicine. However, I soon realised that a clinical career was not the right path for me. This led me to pursue a [Master’s in Medical Statistics](https://medic.usm.my/index.php/biostat), where I discovered a strong passion for data analysis. My medical background gives me a unique perspective, enabling me to bridge the gap between healthcare and data science.
