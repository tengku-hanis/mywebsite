    "section": "",
    "text": "The book offers practical insights into understanding and managing missing data using R, making it an invaluable resource for data analysts and researchers. It covers key topics such as the types of missing data, possible solutions for handling them, and best practices to ensure robust data analysis. With a clear focus on practical implementation, the book equips readers with the skills needed to address real-world challenges in data analysis. Although still a work in progress, an early draft is available for free on the author’s GitHub page."

    "text": "The 1st edition of the printed book was published in 2024 by Chapman & Hall. This book is both comprehensive and highly practical, gives a solid foundation of data and statistical theory for readers. Subsequently, it equips them with practical skills to conduct analyses using the powerful R programming language, widely used by statisticians. The book takes a gentle approach to help readers navigate data and statistical analysis using R, minimizing the learning curve. RStudio is used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for enhanced productivity for readers to run their R codes.\nThe online version of this book is available for free at bookdown website. The printed version of the book is available for purchase at Routledge website."
