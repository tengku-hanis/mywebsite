The use of cause-specific survival is overwhelmingly popular. In contrast, the relative survival approach is almost unknown despite some of its advantages over the cause-specific survival. This talk aims to cover an introduction to relative survival, strengths and limitations of both cause-specific and relative survival approaches, and provide a brief demonstration of relative survival analysis in R.
