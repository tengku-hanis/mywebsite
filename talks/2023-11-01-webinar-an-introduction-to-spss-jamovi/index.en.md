SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a widely used software program for statistical analysis. It provides a user-friendly interface for data management, descriptive statistics, and various advanced statistical techniques. Jamovi, on the other hand, is an open-source, free-to-use statistical software that offers a similar range of analytical tools but with a more modern and intuitive interface. Both SPSS and Jamovi are valuable tools for researchers and analysts conducting statistical analyses, with the choice often depending on user preferences and budget constraints. This webinar introduced participants to both software.
