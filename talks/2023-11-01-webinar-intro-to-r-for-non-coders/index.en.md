R and RStudio are commonly used in data analysis and statistical modeling. R is a powerful open-source programming language that provides a wide range of statistical and data manipulation tools. RStudio, on the other hand, is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) designed specifically for R, offering a user-friendly interface, code editing, and visualization capabilities, making it an essential tool for data analysts and scientists. This webinar introduced the participants to R and RStudio in a systematic and easy to understand approach especially for those without the programming background.
