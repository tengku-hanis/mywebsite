A systematic review is a rigorous and comprehensive approach to summarizing and analyzing existing research on a specific topic or question. It involves a systematic and structured search of the available literature, followed by a meticulous appraisal and synthesis of relevant studies. Systematic reviews are widely used in evidence-based practice and research to provide a high-quality and unbiased overview of the current state of knowledge on a particular subject, helping inform decision-making and policy development. This webinar covered step-by-step how to conduct a systematic review.
